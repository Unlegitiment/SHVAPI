/*
* No Tick Method because if you're rendering a button it should be upto the user to control how the code works.
* Tick methods are only used for updating internal values. such as like backend stuff. I.E native controlled stuff.
* If you NEED a tick method than you probably have something else wrong. Never really use a tick method unless it signifies that an internal value should be changed.
* I.E CMenu(s) should have a Tick() method because they need to A) update the buttons and boxes around them but also in general you want that. 
* tl;dr Tick should be used in cases where LARGE groups of logic needs to be grouped and updated every GameTick. 
* 
* Also unless a Tick() method is specified as a backend (via comment) than don't bother using. Tick backgrounds should go on a seperate thread because they do more stuff more in track with updating weird background values.
* Also Menu(s) should likely use a (static CList<CButtonUI> buttons) So that the values can change and flash so that a value will remain after. Like Green Box and Text should stick.
